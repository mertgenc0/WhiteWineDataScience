# üçá White Wine Quality Prediction

This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting the quality of white wines using machine learning models. The project goes through essential steps, including data analysis, data preprocessing, data visualization, and machine learning model implementation.

## üìã Project Overview

This project uses a dataset containing various chemical properties of white wines, such as acidity, chlorides, and alcohol content, to predict their quality scores. The data is first analyzed and visualized to gain insights into the factors impacting wine quality, then processed for optimal model performance. Finally, different machine learning models are trained and evaluated to determine the best performing model for wine quality prediction.

## Data Analysis 
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the dataset and its distribution. Key findings included:
   **- Understanding correlations between features.**
   **- Identifying outliers and missing values.**
   **- Discovering which features impact the quality score.**
